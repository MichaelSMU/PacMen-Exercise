This is the solution for the coding activity "PacMan Exercise". This exercise aims to create a web page with lots of PacMan moving around, bouncing off the walls all with different speeds that we can add new ones. 

Please follow the steps to run the webpate:
1.Download/clone the repository to a local directory
2.Drag the index.html file the url box of a browser

Future improvement includes:

try to use different pacman pictures for different moving directions
try to mave the mouth move when a pacman is moving.
